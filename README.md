# Resolve Snapshot Timeline
[![pre-commit.ci status](https://results.pre-commit.ci/badge/github/in03/resolve-snapshot-timeline/main.svg)](https://results.pre-commit.ci/latest/github/in03/resolve-snapshot-timeline/main) [![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)
 
## What's it for? ##
Sometimes you want to try out some risky idea, create a couple of variations of a clip-sequence to compare or even just have some timeline backups within easy reach.
Resolve Snapshot Timeline does just that. It's just a quick and easy utility to create timeline versions without going for a deep dive or getting confused about the latest version.
Snapshots just sounds cool. They're just timelines with a version suffix: 

*Organisation - Project - V1, Organisation - Project - V2, Organisation* - Project - V3, etc.

## What does it need?
**This app has a few non-negotiable prerequisites:**
- Python 3.6 **ONLY** (DaVinci Resolve's Python API requires it)
- DaVinci Resolve Studio, with scripting set up (read Resolve's scripting README)

## How do I install it?

### A Warning about Python 3.6
Because DaVinci Resolve requires Python 3.6 to communicate with it's API, no versions over Python 3.6 will work with this app. To avoid dependency conflicts using a tool like *pipx* to isolate installations but keep CLI entrypoints exposed is recommended:

``` 
pipx install git+https://github.com/in03/resolve-snapshot-timeline
```

## How do I use it?

```
rsnaptime --help

## How can I contribute?
Clone the repo, install dependencies, call from poetry shell:
```
