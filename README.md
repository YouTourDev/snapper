## What's it for? ##
Sometimes you want to try out some risky idea, create a couple of variations of a clip-sequence to compare or even just have some timeline backups within easy reach.
Resolve Snapshot Timeline does just that. It's just a quick and easy utility to create timeline versions without going for a deep dive or getting confused about the latest version.
Snapshots just sounds cool. They're just timelines with a version suffix: 

*Organisation - Project - V1, Organisation - Project - V2, Organisation* - Project - V3, etc.

## What does it need?
**This app has a few non-negotiable prerequisites:**
- Python 3.10 - install with pyenv, pipx if you want to keep things tidy
- DaVinci Resolve Studio, with scripting set up (read Resolve's scripting README)

## How do I install it?
pipx install git+https://github.com/in03/snapper

## How do I use it?
